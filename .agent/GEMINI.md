**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Project:** Law Firm Landing Page Platform
**Type:** Single-Tenant SvelteKit Application (Georgios Papadopoulos Law)

## 1. Current Tech Stack

The project is built using a modern, type-safe stack:

- **Framework:** [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) (v2.50.1)
- **UI Library:** [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/) (v5.48.2) - Using Runes (`$state`, `$props`).

- **Backend:** [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) (Data persistence, AI Actions).

## 2. Current State

The project is a high-performance, single-tenant landing page for a specialized lawyer.

### Architecture

- **Static/Dynamic Routing:** `src/routes/[lang]` handles internationalization (EL/EN).
- **Centralized Data:** All site content is managed in `src/lib/data/firms.ts` and `src/lib/data/firm/`.
- **Dynamic Components:** All UI components (Hero, Stats, About, Contact, Footer) are fully props-driven and localized.
- **Icon System:** Centralized Svelte-based icon system in `src/lib/components/icons/` for consistency and theme support.

### Features Implemented

- **Specialized Lawyer Profile:**
  - Adjusted for a professional with 10 years experience.
  - Focused on Intellectual Property, Patent Law, and Digital Law.
- **Full Internationalization (i18n):**
  - Support for Greek and English.
- **Enhanced Contact Section:**
  - Dynamic form with localized validation and topics.
- **Newsletter Subscription:**
  - Integrated into the Footer with Convex backend storage (`newsletter_subscribers` table).
  - Features real-time validation, loading states, and success/error feedback.
- **Admin Dashboard:**
  - Protected route at `/admin`.
  - Inquiry management with AI-powered summarization.

### Completed Improvements (Feb 5, 2026 - Feb 12, 2026)

## 3. Suggestions for Improvement (Roadmap)

### B. Form Handling & Robustness

- **Content Editor:** Allow editing `firmData` via the admin panel.
