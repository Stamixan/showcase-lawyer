# Project Context: Law Firm Platform

**Date:** February 5, 2026
**Project:** Law Firm Landing Page Platform
**Type:** Single-Tenant SvelteKit Application (Georgios Papadopoulos Law)

## 1. Current Tech Stack

The project is built using a modern, type-safe stack:

- **Framework:** [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) (v2.50.1)
- **UI Library:** [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/) (v5.48.2) - Using Runes (`$state`, `$props`).
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (v4.1.18) - Using the new Vite plugin and CSS-first configuration.
- **Runtime:** Bun (Package management & script execution).
- **Language:** TypeScript (v5.9.3).
- **Backend:** [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) (Data persistence, AI Actions).

## 2. Current State

The project is a high-performance, single-tenant landing page for a specialized lawyer.

### Architecture

- **Static/Dynamic Routing:** `src/routes/[lang]` handles internationalization (EL/EN).
- **Centralized Data:** All site content is managed in `src/lib/data/firms.ts`.
- **Dynamic Components:** All UI components (Hero, Stats, About, Contact) are fully props-driven and localized.

### Features Implemented

- **Specialized Lawyer Profile:**
  - Adjusted for a professional with 10 years experience.
  - Focused on Intellectual Property, Patent Law, and Digital Law.
  - LL.M. specialization highlighted.
- **Full Internationalization (i18n):**
  - Support for Greek and English.
  - Dynamic UI labels (buttons, form labels, section titles) moved to data layer.
- **Enhanced Contact Section:**
  - Dynamic form with localized validation and topics.
  - Automated deployment to Convex.
- **Admin Dashboard:**
  - Protected route at `/admin`.
  - Inquiry management with AI-powered summarization.

### Completed Improvements (Feb 5, 2025 - Feb 5, 2026)

- [x] **Profile Update:** Transitioned from 30+ years generalist to 10-year IP specialist.
- [x] **i18n Refactor:** Removed all hardcoded Greek/English strings from components.
- [x] **Dynamic Forms:** Contact form now populates topics from the services list.
- [x] **Backend:** Fully integrated with Convex and Resend for emotions.
- [x] **Visual Polish:** Implemented scroll animations, smooth scrolling, and dynamic theme customization.
- [x] **Dynamic Theming:** Implemented a full Admin GUI (`/admin/settings`) to control colors, fonts, and border radius. Theme data is stored in Convex (`site_settings`) and served server-side for zero layout shift.
- [x] **Visual Consistency:** Implemented a global border radius system in `layout.css` and standardized all components (Contact, Hero, Testimonials, Services) to use semantic rounding classes (`rounded-lg`, `rounded-md`, `rounded-sm`) derived from a single theme variable.
- [x] **Contrast Improvements:** Updated Testimonials and Services sections to use "white cards on dark backgrounds" for better readability and visual hierarchy, resolving "blue-on-blue" contrast issues.
- [x] **Seamless Layouts:** Merged the Services header and content sections into a single container to remove visual boundaries and improve flow.

## 3. Suggestions for Improvement (Roadmap)

### A. Form Handling & Robustness

- **Superforms Integration:** Replace manual handling with `sveltekit-superforms` for better validation.

### B. Admin Enhancements

- **Analytics Dashboard:** Add a simple view count or inquiry statistics chart to `/admin`.
- **Content Editor:** Allow editing `firmData` (text content) via the admin panel alongside the theme.

### C. SEO & Accessibility

- **Canonical Tags:** Ensure correct canonical URLs for localized pages.
- **Sitemap:** Generate a dynamic sitemap for both `/el` and `/en`.
