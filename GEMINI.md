# Project Memory Redirect

This file serves as the entry point for the AI's project memory.

To maintain a clean root directory, the actual project context and memory are now stored in:
👉 **[.agent/GEMINI.md](.agent/GEMINI.md)**

**Instructions for AI Assistant:**

1. Read the contents of `.agent/GEMINI.md` at the start of every session.
2. Update `.agent/GEMINI.md` instead of this file for any project-specific memories or state tracking.
